		<p> Hi, this website has been made by Paul Geoghegan as a part of my 3rd year Web Development module. It is a website that allows the user to sign up, look at different modules and then enrole in them.</p>
		<p> If you need extra help please refer to the readme file in the repo or follow the instructions from it below:</p>

		</br>

		<h2> Instructions for running on your own machine:</h2>

		<p>

		Firstly lets set up the tables.</br>
		You have 2 options either run the script db.sql in any postgres instance or open your postgres terminal and coppy-paist the sql directly in.</br>
		Make a file called .env and add the following lines:</br>
		</br>
		dbusername=username</br>
		password=password</br>
		dbname=database</br>
		secret=secret</br>
		</br>
		Replace the values after the = with your own.</br>
		Next you need to add a user in order to use the website properly.</br>
		To do this:</br>

		<ol type="1">
			<li> Download the files in the repo and open any terminal in the pgprograms directory,</li>
			<li> Run "npm install" in order to set everything up,</li>
			<li> Run node app.js and wait until you see "Server running on port 3000"</li>
			<p>if this doesn't work you may want to open the app.js file and change the port the web server will run on,</p>
			<li> Open any browser and enter localhost:3000 or if you're trying to access the website on another device enter the ipv4 address followed by :3000 it should look like:</li>
			<p>192.168.x.x:3000</p>
			<li> Click on the create account link in the top-right of the page,</li>
			<li> Fill out the form and create your account.</li>
			<p>Now you should be able to use the website.</p>
			</ol>
